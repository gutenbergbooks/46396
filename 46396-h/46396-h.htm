<h2>IN PARIS OUT OF THE SEASON.</h2>

<p class="center">(<i>With some Notes on a Detective Melodrama at the Ambigu.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">
Dear Mr. Punch</span>,&mdash;When I announced my intention of running over to
Paris for a few days, my friend <span class="smcap">Buzzard</span> looked at me with a stony
contempt. "To Paris?" he said, "at this time of year! Why, you must be
mad. What on earth are you going to do there?" I tried to explain to
<span class="smcap">Buzzard</span>, whose frigid superiority frightens me, that I liked Paris, that
I was going there <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="to loosen up">pour me dégourdir</i>; that it was just as possible to
breakfast at <span class="smcap">Ledoyen's</span> or <span class="smcap">Voisin's</span>, and to dine at <span class="smcap">Durand's</span> or <span class="smcap">Joseph's</span>
in September as at any other time; that a few theatres were still open;
that the Boulevards were there for the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="strollers">flâneur</i>; but I failed to
penetrate his scorn, even with the most idiomatic French at my command.
However, I determined that <span class="smcap">Buzzard</span>, like the weight of the elephant in
the problem, must be neglected; and here I am in the Rue de Rivoli with
another madman like unto myself. We take our <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="full coffee">café complet</i> in bed; we
wear beautiful French ties, made of <i>foulard</i>, with two vast ends
floating like banners in the Parisian breeze&mdash;in a word, we are
thoroughly enjoying ourselves in an entirely non-British
fashion&mdash;which I take, indeed, to be of the essence of a pleasant
holiday. What care we for the echoes of the Trades Union Congress; for
the windiest of <span class="smcap">Keir Hardie's</span>
blatancies; for the malignities of Mr.
<span class="smcap">Chamberlain</span>, or the failure of Lord
<span class="smcap">Rosebery's</span> <i>Ladas</i> at Doncaster? We
are in Paris, and the sight of a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="Dreadnaught">cuirassier</i> trotting past with his
great black <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="mane">crinière</i> waving behind, or of the lady bicyclists scudding
by in knickerbockers, excites us more than even the latest ravings of
the newest woman in London. <span class="smcap">Buzzard</span> be blowed! You may tell him I said
so.</p>

<div class="figleft w25">

</div>

<p>I want to let Mr. <span class="smcap">Conan Doyle</span> know that there is a great opening
for him here. If I may judge by the latest detective drama, the
ideas of the Parisian public with regard to the acumen and general
power of a detective are still very primitive. Yet <span class="smcap">Gaboriau</span> did
something in this line, and, in the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Vicomte de Bragelonne</i>, did not
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">d'Artagnan</i> show himself on the occasion of a certain duel to be a
detective of unmatchable force? Still the fact remains that the
play-going Parisian public is easily satisfied in the matter of detectives.
Listen, if you doubt me, to a plain unvarnished account of
"<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La Belle Limonadière</i>," the "<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="Big new drama in five acts, eight scenes">Grand drame nouveau en cinq
actes, huit tableaux</i>," which is now running gloomily, but with
immense success, at the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ambigu</i>.</p>

<p><i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Madame de Mazerolles</i>, a wealthy widow, is, in the first Act,
robbed and brutally murdered by her stepson, <i>Roland</i>, a dissipated
young man, who is incited to the commission of the crime by his
wicked mistress <i>Sabine</i>. <i>Vidocq</i>, the great representative of the new
school in detection (<i>circa</i> A.D. 1820), is away at the time, and in his
absence the investigation falls to his rival <i>Yvrier</i>, who belongs to the
old school. In the chamber of death <i>Yvrier</i> soon makes up his mind
that the guilty person is one <i>Henri Lebrun</i>, a faithful and gigantic
old soldier, much given to beating his breast with both fists and
talking at large about his services to his country, his immaculate
honesty and his domestic virtues. Suddenly <i>Vidocq</i> enters. He discovers
that the assassin has entered by a certain door because a cobweb
has been disturbed, he picks up a red flower dropped by the
assassin, he pours contempt on the crass stupidity of <i>Yvrier</i>&mdash;all
quite in the best Sherlock Holmes style. But nothing comes of it all.
Poor <i>Henri Lebrun</i>, still beating his breast with fists, is arrested, and
after a painful interview with his only daughter (whom he discovers
to have been the mistress of <i>George</i>, the son of <i>Madame Mazerolles</i>),
he becomes sublime, accuses himself quite unnecessarily of the murder
he had never committed, and is marched off to prison amid the
execrations of the populace, the triumph of the crass <i>Yvrier</i>, and the
loudly expressed determination of <i>Vidocq</i> to bring the guilty to
justice and save the life of the innocent <i>Lebrun</i>. Time passes.
<i>Lebrun</i>, overwhelmed by an entire absence of proofs, is tried and
condemned to death. It is the morning appointed for his execution.
The curtain rises in the upper floor of a restaurant commanding an
extensive view of the guillotine. The sight-seers troop in. First of
all comes <i>Roland</i>, the murderer, disguised in black as a wicked
Marquis, and accompanied by the infamous <i>Sabine</i>. <i>Hélène Lebrun</i>,
the daughter of the condemned man, also troops in to slow music in
black. There is a commotion at the door, and the obsequious innkeeper
backs on to the stage ushering in <i>Milord Sir John Stilton</i> and
his son "<i>Shames</i>." <i>Sir John</i> is dressed in an enormous green
swallow-tailed coat with brass buttons, a striped yellow waistcoat, a
pair of yellow knickerbockers, and stockings brilliantly striped with
red and black. On his head he wears a low-crowned hat. In one
hand he carries an umbrella, while a telescope dangles from his
Shoulders by a strap. In short, he is <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="could not be more English">tout-ce-qu'il-y-a de plus
Anglais</i>. His son <i>Shames</i> is even more aggressively British. <i>Sir
John</i> orders lunch: "<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="give me a steak">vous donner moa bifteck</i>" is the obvious
formula. <i>Shames</i> concurs with a "Yehs, Pappah," which provokes
roars of laughter. But stay, what is this? <i>Sir John</i> takes <i>Shames</i>
aside: they talk in beautiful French. Can it be? Yes, by Heaven,
it is the great <i>Vidocq</i> with his faithful <i>Coco-Latour</i>! We breathe
again, for now we know that the innocent man is safe. The procession,
however, approaches. The condemned man speaks from
below to his daughter in the balcony. He declares his innocence.
Now good <i>Vidocq</i>, to the rescue. Display all your arts, convict the
guilty, disguised Marquis, and save the estimable <i>Lebrun</i>! But
<i>Vidocq</i> looks on impassive, a dull thud is heard and the head of the
innocent rolls into the basket. Immediately afterwards <i>Yvrier</i>
staggers in. Too late, he says, he has been convinced of <i>Lebrun's</i>
innocence. At the last moment <i>Lebrun</i> looked at him with eyes in
which there was no trace of guilt. That last look did it, and now
<i>Yvrier</i> in a passion of repentance offers himself to help <i>Vidocq</i>, even
in the most subordinate capacity, to track down the guilty, and to
remove the stain from <i>Lebrun's</i> name. I pass over the padding,
during which <i>Vidocq</i> appears, for no earthly reason, in numerous disguises,
and come to the last scene. <i>Roland</i> has all but killed <i>George
Mazerolles</i> in a duel, he has murdered <i>Sabine</i>, who, before dying,
rounds on him, and he is now, by a strange conjunction of circumstances,
in the very room in which he murdered <i>Madame Mazerolles</i>.
Thither also comes everybody else. <i>Vidocq</i>, who is tracking <i>Roland</i>,
discovers, through a paper belonging to the late <i>Madame Mazerolles</i>,
that <i>Roland</i>, her murderer, was her son, not her step-son, and that he,
<i>Vidocq</i>, is the father of <i>Roland</i>. In his youth <i>Vidocq</i> had been a soldier.
Somewhere he had met <i>Madame Mazerolles</i>. "<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="We loved between two battles, between two victories">Nous nous sommes
aimés entre deux batailles, entre deux victoires</i>," and <i>Roland</i> was the
fruit of their love. Horror of horrors! What is he to do? First he
tells <i>Roland</i> that he killed, not his step-mother, but his mother. At
this awful intelligence, <i>Roland</i> faints in an armchair for precisely ten
seconds. Recovering himself, he is fain to escape. <i>Vidocq</i>, all his
fatherly instincts aroused, says he shall. The weak <i>Yvrier</i> consents,
when suddenly, from behind a curtain, appears <i>Hélène Lebrun</i> in
black. The murderer of her father must not escape, she declares,
whereupon the great detective, vowing that his son shall never be
food for the guillotine, shoots him dead with a toy pistol in the
region of the left waistcoat pocket. Tableau! Curtain!</p>

<p>There, <i>Mr. Punch</i>, you have the French <i>Sherlock</i> on the stage.
A wonderful man, is he not?</p>

<h2>THANKS TO THE "BYSTANDER."</h2>

<p>I am glad to see the "<span class="smcap">Bystander</span>" in the <i>Graphic</i> has recently
uttered a startled protest against the fashion, now somewhat overdone,
and occasionally objectionably done, of lady-begging for
charitable purposes in the London streets. On the sudden apparition
of one of these merry half-sisters of charity (were not the Pecksniffian
daughters Charity and Merry?) Mr. <span class="smcap">Ashby Sterry</span> became well-nigh
hysterrycal, and his generosity being temporarily paralysed,
he fled, with pockets tightly buttoned. For the moment he was no
longer the "<span class="smcap">Bystander</span>," whose motto is that of <i>Captain Cuttle</i>,
"Stand by," but, as though he had heard the command to "Stand
and deliver," our sturdy "<span class="smcap">Bystander</span>" became a fugitive from
before the face of the giddy charity girl, and thus at one "go" saved
his halfpence and his honour. For his reputation would have suffered
had he impolitely rebuffed his fair unfair assailant. He did well to
flee, he did still better to write and publicly complain. We trust that
this process adopted by <i>the</i> Sterry O'Type (a fine old Irish title by the
way) may have its due influence, and that the abuse, which has
become thus Sterry O'Typed, of a fashion good in itself and its origin,
may soon cease to exist. <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="Meanwhile">En attendant</i>, <i>Mr. Punch</i> is pleased to
know that the "<span class="smcap">Bystander</span>" is still running on, and not likely to
come to a standstill.

<h2>A ST. LEGER COINCIDENCE.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Punch</span>,&mdash;Will you afford
me a small portion of your space to put on record once and for ever a
most extraordinary coincidence? Last Wednesday afternoon I was taking a
country walk, when all at once my eye was suddenly caught by a throstle.
At the same time I accidentally looked at my watch. It had stopped at
12.10. When I got home I mentioned both of these circumstances to my
wife.</p>

<p>Later in the evening I bought an evening paper, and was amazed to find
that the St. Leger had been won by <i>Throstle</i> (the bird I had seen),
which had started at 50 to 1 (the exact minute at which my watch had
stopped)! Could the force of coincidence farther go? The Society
of Psychical Research and Mr. <span class="smcap">Stead</span>
are welcome to this incident. The only thing which troubles me at all is
that the evidence (other than my own) is a little slender. My wife is
deaf, and never heard what I told her. The bird has flown. My watch is
going again.</p>

<p>I inclose my card, and am,</p>

<p class="i2">Yours <span class="smcap">Stead-y</span> to a degree,</p>

<p class="i4 smcap">One who Won Nothing on the Race.</p>

<p class="center">PART XII.&mdash;DIGNITY UNDER DIFFICULTIES.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Scene XXI.</span>&mdash;<i>The Housekeeper's Room at Wyvern</i>; Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pomfret</span>,
<i>the Housekeeper, in a black silk gown and her smartest cap, is
seated in a winged arm-chair by the fire, discussing domestic
politics with</i> Lady <span class="smcap">Culverin's</span> <i>maid</i>, Miss <span class="smcap">Stickler</span>. <i>The Chef</i>,
<span class="smcap">M. Ridevos</span>, <i>is resting on the sofa, in languid converse with</i> Mlle.
<span class="smcap">Chiffon</span>, Miss <span class="smcap">Spelwane's</span> <i>maid</i>; <span class="smcap">Pilliner's</span> <i>man</i>, <span class="smcap">Louch</span>,
<i>watches</i> <span class="smcap">Steptoe</span>, Sir <span class="smcap">Rupert's</span> <i>valet, with admiring envy, as he
makes himself agreeable to</i> Miss <span class="smcap">Phillipson</span>, <i>who is in demi-toilette,
as are all the other ladies' maids present</i>.</p>

<p><i>Miss Stickler (in an impressive undertone).</i> All I <i>do</i> say, Mrs.
<span class="smcap">Pomfret</span>, ma'am, is this: if that girl <span class="smcap">Louisa</span> marches into the pew
to-morrow, as she did <i>last</i> Sunday, before the second laundry maid&mdash;and
her only under-scullery maid&mdash;such presumptiousness should be
put a stop to in future!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Pomfret (wheezily).</i> Depend upon it, my dear, it's her
ignorance; but I shall most certainly speak about it. Girls must be
taught that ranks was made to be respected, and the precedency into that
pew has come down from time immemoriable, and is not to be set aside by
such as her while <i>I</i>'m 'ousekeeper here.</p>

<p><i>Mlle. Chiffon</i> (<i>in French, to</i> <span class="smcap">M. Ridevos</span>). You have the air fatigued,
my poor friend! Oh, there&mdash;but fatigued!</p>

<p><i>M. Ridevos.</i> Broken, Mademoiselle, absolutely broken. But what will
you? This night I surpass myself. I achieve a masterpiece&mdash;a
sublime pyramid of quails with a sauce that will become classic. I pay
now the penalty of a veritable crisis of nerves. It is of my temperament
as artist.</p>

<p><i>Mlle. Chiffon.</i> And me, my poor friend, how I have suffered from the
cookery of these others&mdash;I who have the stomach so feeble, so
fastidious! Figure to yourself an existence upon the villainous curry,
the abominable "Iahristue," beloved by these barbarians, but which
succeed with me not

at all&mdash;oh, but not at all! Since I am here&mdash;ah, the difference! I
digest as of old&mdash;I am gay. But next week to return with Mademoiselle
to the curry, my poor friend, what regrets!</p>

<p><i>M. Rid.</i> For me, dear Mademoiselle, for me the regrets&mdash;to hear
no more the conversation, so spiritual, so sympathetic, of a fellow-countrywoman.
For remark that here they are stupid&mdash;they comprehend
not. And the old ones they roll at me the eyes to make
terror. Behold this Gorgon who approaches. She adores me, my
word of honour, this ruin!</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[Miss <span class="smcap">Stickler</span> <i>comes up to the sofa smiling in happy unconsciousness</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Miss Stick, (graciously).</i> So you've felt equal to joining us for once,
Mossoo! We feel it a very 'igh compliment, I can assure you.
We've really been feeling quite 'urt at the way you keep to yourself&mdash;you
might be a regular 'ermit for all <i>we</i> see of you!</p>

<p><i>M. Rid.</i> For invent, dear Mees, for create, ze arteeste must live ze
solitaire as of rule. To-night&mdash;no! I emairge, as you see, to
res-tore myself viz your smile.</p>

<p><i>Miss Stick, (flattered).</i> Well, I've always said, Mossoo, and
I always <i>will</i> say, that for polite 'abits and pretty speeches, give <i>me</i>
a Frenchman!</p>

<p><i>M. Rid. (alarmed).</i> For me it is too moch 'appiness. For anozzer,
ah!</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>He kisses his fingers with ineffable grace.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>Phillipson</i> (<i>advancing to meet</i> Miss <span class="smcap">Dolman</span>, <i>who has just entered</i>).
Why, I'd no idea I should meet <i>you</i> here, <span class="smcap">Sarah</span>! And how have
you been getting on, dear? Still with&mdash;&mdash;?</p>

<p><i>Miss Dolman (checking her with a look).</i> Her grace? No, we
parted some time ago. I'm with Lady <span class="smcap">Rhoda Cokayne</span> at present.
(<i>In an undertone, as she takes her aside.</i>) You needn't say anything
here of your having known me at Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dickenson's</span>. I couldn't
afford to have it get about in the circle I'm in that I'd ever lived
with any but the nobility. I'm sure you see what I mean. Of
course I don't mind your saying we've <i>met</i>.</p>

<p><i>Phill.</i> Oh, I <i>quite</i> understand. I'll say nothing. I'm obliged to
be careful myself, being maid to Lady <span class="smcap">Maisie Mull</span>.</p>

<p><i>Miss Dolm.</i> My <i>dear</i> <span class="smcap">Emma</span>! It <i>is</i> nice seeing you again&mdash;such
<i>friends</i> as we used to be!</p>

<p><i>Phill.</i> At her Grace's? I'm afraid you're thinking of somebody
else. (<i>She crosses to</i> Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pomfret</span>.) Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pomfret</span>, what's
become of the gentleman I travelled down with&mdash;the horse doctor?
I do hope he means to come in; he would amuse <i>you</i>, Mr. <span class="smcap">Steptoe</span>.
I never heard anybody go on like him; he <i>did</i> make me laugh so!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Pomfr.</i> I really can't say <i>where</i> he is, my dear. I sent up
word to let him know he was welcome here whenever he pleased;
but perhaps he's feeling a little shy about coming down.</p>

<p><i>Phill.</i> Oh, I don't think he suffers much from <i>that</i>. (<i>As the door
opens.</i>) Ah, <i>there</i> he is!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Pomfr.</i> (<i>rising, with dignity, to receive</i> <span class="smcap">Undershell</span>, <i>who
enters in obvious embarrassment</i>). Come in, Sir. I'm glad to see you've
found your way down at last. Let me see, I haven't the advantage of
knowing your&mdash;Mr. <span class="smcap">Undershell</span>, <i>to</i> be sure! Well, Mr. <span class="smcap">Undershell</span>,
we're very pleased to see you. I hope you'll make yourself quite at
home. Her ladyship gave particular directions that we was to look after
you&mdash;<i>most</i> particular she was!</p>

<p><i>Undershell.</i> You are very good, Ma'am. I am obliged to Lady <span class="smcap">Culverin</span>
for her (<i>with a gulp</i>) condescension.
But I shall not trespass more than a short time upon your hospitality.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Pomfr.</i> Don't speak of it as trespassing, Sir. It's not often we
have a gentleman of your profession as a visitor, but you are none the
less welcome. Now I'd better introduce you all round, and then you won't
feel yourself a stranger. Miss <span class="smcap">Phillipson</span> you <i>have</i> met, I know.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>She introduces him to the
others in turn</i>; <span class="smcap">Undershell</span>
<i>bows helplessly</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Steptoe (with urbanity).</i> Your fame, Sir, has preceded you. And you'll
find us a very friendly and congenial little circle on a better
acquaintance&mdash;if this is your first experience of this particular
form of society?</p>

<p><i>Und. (to himself).</i> I mustn't be stiff, I'll put them at their ease.
(<i>Aloud.</i>) Why, I must admit, Mr. <span class="smcap">Steptoe</span>, that I have never before
had the privilege of entering the&mdash;(<i>with an ingratiating smile all
round him</i>) the "Pugs' Parlour," as I understand you call this
very charming room.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>The company draw themselves up and cough in disapprobation.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>Stept. (very stiffly).</i> Pardon <i>me</i>, Sir, you have been totally misinformed.
Such an expression is not current <i>here</i>.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Pomfr. (more stiffly still).</i> It is never alluded to in <i>my</i>
presence except as the 'Ousekeeper's Room, which is the right and
proper name for it. There may be some other term for it in the
Servants' 'All for anything <i>I</i> know to the contrary&mdash;but if you'll
excuse me for saying so, Mr. <span class="smcap">Undershell</span>, we'd prefer for it not to
be repeated in <i>our</i> presence.</p>

<p><i>Und. (confusedly).</i> I&mdash;I beg ten thousand pardons. (<i>To himself.</i>)
To be pulled up like this for trying to be genial&mdash;it's really <i>too
humiliating</i>!</p>

<p><i>Stept. (relaxing).</i> Well, well, Sir; we must make some allowances
for a neophyte. You'll know better another time, <i>I</i> daresay. Miss
<span class="smcap">Phillipson</span> here has been giving you a very favourable character as
a highly agreeable rattle, Mr. <span class="smcap">Undershell</span>. I hope we may
be favoured with a specimen of your social talents later on. We're
always grateful here for anything in that way&mdash;such as a recitation
now, or a comic song, or a yumorous imitation&mdash;anything, in short,
calculated to promote the general harmony and festivity will be
appreciated.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span></p>

<p><i>Miss (Stick acidly).</i> Provided it is free from any helement of
coarseness, which we do <i>not</i> encourage&mdash;far from it!</p>

<p><i>Und. (suppressing his irritation).</i> You need be under no alarm,
Madam. I do not propose to attempt a performance of <i>any</i> kind.</p>

<p><i>Phill.</i> Don't be so solemn, Mr. <span class="smcap">Undershell</span>! I'm sure you can
be as comical as any playactor when you choose!</p>

<p><i>Und.</i> I really don't know how I can have given you that impression.
If you expect me to treat my lyre like a <i>horse-collar</i>, and grin
through it, I'm afraid I am unable to gratify you.</p>

<p><i>Stept. (at sea).</i> Capital, Sir, the professional allusion very neat.
You'll come out presently, <i>I</i> can see, when supper's on the table.
Can't expect you to rattle till you've something <i>inside</i> of you, can we?</p>

<p><i>Miss Stick.</i> Reelly, Mr. <span class="smcap">Steptoe</span>, I <i>am</i> surprised at such commonness
from <i>you</i>!</p>

<p><i>Stept.</i> Now you're too severe, Miss <span class="smcap">Stickler</span>, you are indeed. An
innocent little Judy Mow like that!</p>

<p><i>Tredwell (outside).</i> Don't answer <i>me</i>, Sir. Ham I butler 'ere, or
ham I <i>not</i>? I've a precious good mind to report you for such a
hignorant blunder.... I don't want to hear another word about the
gentleman's cloes&mdash;you'd no hearthly business for to do such a thing
at all! (<i>He enters and flings himself down on a chair.</i>) That <span class="smcap">Thomas</span>
is beyond everything&mdash;stoopid <i>hass</i> as he is!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Pomfr. (concerned).</i> La, Mr. <span class="smcap">Tredwell</span>, you <i>do</i> seem put
out! Whatever have <span class="smcap">Thomas</span> been doing <i>now</i>?</p>

<p><i>Und. (to himself).</i> It's really very good of him to take it to heart
like this! (<i>Aloud.</i>) Pray don't let it distress you; it's of no
consequence, none at all!</p>

<p><i>Tred. (glaring).</i> I'm the best judge of that, Mr. <span class="smcap">Undershell</span>, Sir&mdash;if
you'll allow <i>me</i>; <i>I</i> don't call my porogatives of no consequence,
whatever <i>you</i> may! And that feller <span class="smcap">Thomas</span>, Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pomfret</span>,
actially 'ad the hordacity, without consulting me previous, to go and
'and a note to one of our gentlemen at the hupstairs table, all about
some hassinine mistake he'd made with his cloes! What call had
he to take it upon himself? I feel puffecly disgraced that such a
thing should have occurred under my authority!</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>The</i> Steward's Room Boy <i>has entered with a dish, and listens
with secret anxiety on his own account</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Und.</i> I assure you there is no harm done. The gentleman is
wearing my evening clothes&mdash;but he's going to return them&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>The conclusion of the sentence is drowned in a roar of laughter
from the majority.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>Tred. (gasping).</i> Hevenin' cloes! <i>Your</i> hevenin'&mdash;&mdash; P'raps you'll
'ave the goodness to explain yourself, Sir!</p>

<p><i>Stept.</i> No, no, <span class="smcap">Tredwell</span>, my dear fellah, you don't understand
our friend here&mdash;he's a bit of a wag, don't you see? He's only
trying to pull your leg, that's all: and, Gad, he did it too! But
you mustn't take liberties with <i>this</i> gentleman, Mr. <span class="smcap">Undershell</span>,
he's an important personage <i>here</i>, I can tell you!</p>

<p><i>Und. (earnestly).</i> But I never meant&mdash;if you'll only let me
explain&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>The</i> Boy <i>has come behind him, and administers a surreptitious
kick, which</i> <span class="smcap">Undershell</span> <i>rightly construes as a hint to hold
his tongue.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>Tred. (in solemn offence).</i> I'm accustomed, Mr. <span class="smcap">Hundershell</span>, to
be treated in this room with respect and deference&mdash;especially by
them as come here in the capacity of Guests. <i>From</i> such I regard
any attempt to pull my leg as in hindifferent taste&mdash;to say the least
of it. I wish to 'ave no more words on the subjick, which is a painful
one, and had better be dropped, for the sake of all parties.
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pomfret</span>, I see supper is on the table, so, by your leave, we
had better set down to it.</p>

<p><i>Phill.</i> (<i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Undershell</span>). Never mind <i>him</i>, pompous old thing!
It <i>was</i> awfully cheeky of you, though. You can sit next <i>me</i> if
you like.</p>

<p><i>Und. (to himself, as he avails himself of this permission).</i> I shall
only make things worse if I explain now. But, oh, great Heavens,
<i>what</i> a position for a Poet.</p>

<h2>NEW LAMPS FOR OLD.</h2>

<p>Art was once defined as "the creation of new forms of beauty."
Our juvenile geniuses have altered all that. "The New Art" is
better defined as "the creation of novel forms of ugliness." Its
inspiration is Corruption, its auxiliaries are the two hideous imps,
Scratch and Smudge. Old Art, with its bosh about beauty, its rot
about romance, its fudge about finish, its twaddle about taste, will
be good enough to take a back seat. Apollo the Inspirer must give
way to the sooty imp and incubus, New Scratch!&mdash;</p>

hat" and the woman's new hat? The query would make a good
one for a French Exercise Book.</p>

<h2>THAT ADVANCED WOMAN!</h2>

<p class="center">(<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="A Symposium in Fashion.">A Symposium à la Mode.</i>)</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Author of
"A Saddis Aster"
confesses.</div>

<p>I am much flattered by your kind invitation
to discuss the Advanced Woman, but
an initial difficulty suggests itself to me.
Can one discuss the Advanced Woman if this Advanced Woman herself
is non-existent? I am aware, of course, that
she has stridden large of late in the pages of feminine
fiction, but is she not as extinct (before she
has ever existed) as her <span class="smcap">Dodo</span> title? Let me make
my own confession. I have used, if I did not
invent, the A. W. I have secured a remunerative
public. Once on a time I wrote of life as I found
it. I used my eyes and ears, and endeavoured to
let the world have the result in the old-fashioned,
wholesome story. It was a dreary failure. The
critics commended my style, and the public let me
severely alone. <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="We changed all that.">Nous avons changé tout cela.</i> A
theatrical manager who finds his musical piece
begin to drag, saves the situation by a New
Edition&mdash;in other words, by two new songs and
some fresh dances. In a similar way I secured a
reputation by dragging in (at times by her very
heel) the Advanced Woman. True that she resembles no one in
actual existence, true, indeed, that she is outrageously and offensively
improbable, but the public were not happy till they got her. They're
happy now. So am I.</p>

<img src="images/142b.png"
alt="" /></a>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">Mrs. Shriek Shriekon
speaks out.</div>

<p>I should have thought that <i>my</i> views on
the Advanced Woman were sufficiently well
known; but, since you ask my opinion, I may
say at once that I lose no opportunity of inveighing against this <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="end-of-century abomination">fin-de-siècle</i>
abomination. Once on a time it was not thought unbecoming
for a woman to be modest and retiring. She knew her
sphere, and, queen in her own selected world, she did not aspire to a
sovereignty which naturally belonged to others. If they were alive
to-day (and, after all, some of them are), our grandmothers would
hardly know their <span class="smcap">Grand</span> children&mdash;the Heavenly Twins. I am glad
that I am permitted to keep burning the sacred lamp of the Old
Womanhood. Indeed, it looks as if the jeers which a thoughtless
world has hitherto reserved for the Old Maid were being transferred
to the Old Woman. Yet to those who have never yielded to the spell
of the latter-day notions, there is only dismay in the spectacle of the
Advanced Woman sweeping triumphantly on, with her mind full of
sex-problems she has not brains enough to understand, and her
breath stained with the trace of cigarettes she does not care to
conceal. Wholesomeness dies at being dubbed old-fashioned;
Modesty does not survive the disgrace of not being up to date. It's
a bad world, my masters, and I'm never tired of saying so.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Ann U. Woman
dreams
of the Future.</div>

<p>The fact that you have invited my opinion
with full knowledge of what I shall say, emboldens
me to speak out. Man's day (which,
like every dog, he has had) draws to an end. For centuries he has
had Woman at his mercy. What she is to-day, that he has made
her. And what is she? His Doll, his Slave, his "Old Woman."
But Man made one fatal mistake. In a weak moment he consented
to allow Woman to earn her own living. From that moment our
ultimate triumph was assured. Now we know our strength. Told
of old that we were brainless, we now become Senior Wranglers.
Condemned aforetime to inactivity, we now realise that in life's
struggle there are no prizes we are not competent to secure, though,
of course, we are not always permitted. We have precipitated ourselves
out of a yellow miasma of stagnant sloth into an emancipated,
and advanced day. The Advanced Woman has come to stay&mdash;but
not with any husband. She will be as free as the air, as strong as
the eagle. I must stop, as to do any more fine writing would be to
anticipate my next novel. Be sure to get it. It will be called&mdash;&mdash;

<h2>"TRIPPING MERRILY."</h2>

<p>That holiday cruise on board the good steamship <i>Cannie Donia</i>!
Did I dream it? or was it a reality? "Are there wisions about?"
It seems like yesterday or like years ago, and I know it was neither.
"Old <span class="smcap">Kaspar's</span>,"&mdash;or let us say middle-aged <span class="smcap">Kaspar's</span>,&mdash;"work was
done" <i>pro tem.</i>, and he could not neglect so great an opportunity, nor
refuse so inviting an invitation as that sent him by Sir <span class="smcap">Charles
Cheerie</span>, the Chairman, to come aboard for the trial trip of the
G.S.S. <i>Cannie Donia</i>. So I, middle-aged <span class="smcap">Kaspar</span>, work done as
aforesaid, did then and thereby become <span class="smcap">Tommy</span> the Tripper, and,
as such, went aboard the gallant SS. abovementioned, all-to-the-contrary,
nevertheless, and notwithstanding.</p>

<p>And what a goodly company!</p>

<p>Sir <span class="smcap">Charles</span> and Lady <span class="smcap">Cheerie</span>, perfect host and hostess in
themselves. Here too was our <span class="smcap">Toby</span>, M.P., waggish as ever. "I
am not down on the official list of guests as '<span class="smcap">Tobias</span>,'" quoth he. "And
why?" I gave it up. "Because," says he, answering his own conundrum, "I
am a free and independent scribe, and there is nothing <i>to bias</i> me.
Aha!" The sea air agrees with <span class="smcap">Toby</span>, M.P. "And where <i>would</i> the Member
for Barkshire be," he asks, propounding as it were another and a better
puzzle, "but aboard a bonnie barque? My bark," he continues gaily, "may
be worse than my bite, but&mdash;&mdash;" Here the bugle-call to
breakfast sounds, and from ocular evidence I can roundly assert that
whatever his bark may be, I will back his bite&mdash;and this without
backbiting, of which, as I trust, neither of us is capable&mdash;against
that of any two of his own size and weight. Yet <span class="smcap">Toby</span> <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="while eating">en mangeant</i> is
not the dog in a manger, no, not by any means! With one eye to the main
chance, and another to the corresponding comfort of his co-breakfasters,
so pursueth he his steadfast course, as indeed do we all, to the
astonishment of most of us, through the shoals of toast and butter; over
the shallows of eggs; safely through the Straits of Kipper and Kurrie;
with a pleasant time in Hot Tea Bay; then through a Choppy sea, between
the dangerous rocks of Brawn and Bacon; into the calm Marmaladean Sea,
where we ride at anchor and all is well.</p>

<p>After breakfast, the cigar, or
pipe, with conversational accompaniment,
what time we pace
the quarter-deck. Prognostications
as to probable weather are
"taken and offered" by nautically-attired
guests, who, in a general way, may be supposed from
their seagoing costume "to know the ropes." Here is the ever
amiable and truly gallant Sir <span class="smcap">Peter Plural</span>, looking every inch the
ideal yachtsman, as honorary member of the Upper House of Cowes
and Ryde Piers. Wonderful man Sir <span class="smcap">Peter!</span> knows everybody, is
liked by everybody; has been yachting and sailing and voyaging
for any number of years; knows even the smallest waves by sight,
and, if asked, could probably tell you their names! One day he will
publish his reminiscences!</p>

<p>We anchor off Queenstown. The estimable, jovial <span class="smcap">Valentine
Vulcan</span>, M.P., from the North, must ashore to purchase some trifling
knickknacks by way of mementoes of the visit. Instead of "knickknacks"
he lays in a stock of "knock-knocks," yclept "shillelaghs,"
which are served out to him by a delicately pale beauty of
Erin, dark-haired, slim waisted, and as elegant as might be any
natty girl from County Trim. She shows us some dozen shillelaghs
with hard, murderous-looking, bulbous knobs.</p>

<p>"Phew!" whistles <span class="smcap">Valentine Vulcan</span>, M.P., weighing one of
these dainty sticks in his hand. "You might get rather a nasty
crack from this." I agree with him, and the sad daughter of Erin
regards us sadly and sympathetically.</p>

<p>"Maybe," I think to myself, "she has lost a friend or a lover in one
of these confounded <span class="smcap">O'Capulet</span> and <span class="smcap">O'Montague</span> rows. Poor girl!"
And I eye her with a look wherein admiration is tempered with pity.
It occurs to me that I will say something appropriate, just to show
her how I, a stranger and a Saxon, feel for her. It may lead her to
express her hearty detestation of these faction-fights, and of these
deadly fracas with the armed constabulary. So I say, with a touch
of deep indignation in my tone, "It's a shame," say I, "that such
things as these"&mdash;and I nod frowningly at the shillelaghs, which
<span class="smcap">Vulcan</span>, M.P., is twirling meditatively, one in each hand, as if right
and left were about to fight it out&mdash;"it's a shame that such things
as these should be permitted!" The pale, sad, beautiful daughter of
Erin, regards me mournfully, and then, in a tone expressive of
astonishment blended with firm remonstrance, she asks,&mdash;</p>

<p>"An' what <i>would</i> the poor Boys use, an' they not allowed fire-arms?"</p>

<p>That was all. No smile is on the lips of Erin's pale daughter. She is
apparently in earnest, though both <span class="smcap">Vulcan</span> and myself, talking it over
subsequently, unite in opinion that, perhaps, she had been availing
herself of this rare and unique opportunity of "getting at" the Saxon.</p>

<p>So she went on recommending sticks and photographs, and did a good bit
of business with our generous <span class="smcap">Vulcan</span>, M.P., who returned, laden with
gifts for various fellow-guests aboard the good SS. <i>Cannie Donia</i>.</p>

<p>What amusing nights and delightful days! The ladies&mdash;bless
'em!&mdash;all charming, and very Barkisses in their perpetual
"willingness" to do anything and everything that might give pleasure and
afford amusement. Two fairy-gifted maidens entertain us mightily with a
capital dramatic sketch of their own composition; others follow suit,
playing the piano; and a <i>sestette</i> perform, without previous rehearsal,
glees, madrigals, part-songs, and choruses to popular plantation
melodies, under the leadership of that masterly musician <span class="smcap">Tom Tolderol</span>,
whose only regret is that he has not been able to bring on board with
him his sixteen-horse-power-fifty-stopped-sixteen-pedal organ (designed
and made by the eminent firm of <span class="smcap">Bellows, Blower &amp; Co.</span>, at a cost of
some few thousand pounds), though, as he explains to us, he would have
done so, had this musical mammoth been only compressible within the
limits of an ordinary carpet bag.</p>

<p>However, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">à propos</i> of organs, we have with us a representative of one
of the greatest organs&mdash;of the Press&mdash;full of wise saws and
modern instances; as jolly as a sandboy, or rather as a schoolboy out
for a holiday. A sailor every inch of him, and this is saying a
great deal, as he must be over six feet, and broad in proportion.</p>

<p>Appropriate, too, as aboard "the craft," is the presence of the
Great Grand Secretary, Mr. <span class="smcap">Benjamin Boaz</span>, A.M., P.G.M., &amp;c., &amp;c.,
and the still Greater, Grander Something Else, P.P.M., &amp;c., Sir
<span class="smcap">Jonathan Jachin</span>, mysterious officers, <i>Arcades ambo</i>, of the Secret
Rites of Masonry, fall of nods, winks, becks, wreathed smiles, signs,
secrets, fun, frolic, and tales galore.</p>

<p>Ah! the happy days! And the happy evenings! What excellent
"toasts" and "returnings of thanks" by my Lord <span class="smcap">Affidavit</span>, by Sir
<span class="smcap">Poseidon À Vinklo</span> (President of the Anchorite Court), by <span class="smcap">Andrew
McJason</span> (senior of the Argonautic Firm that built the good ship
<i>Cannie Donia</i>), and the sprightliest speech of all by Sir <span class="smcap">Charles
Cheerie</span>!</p>

<p>Round to Falmouth, up the Fal, "with our Fal, lal, la," as singeth
our brilliant <i>sestette</i> to piano, or, to quote Sir <span class="smcap">Jonathan</span>, "our P.
an' O." accompaniment.</p>

<p>Then S'uth'ards! Then.... But "here break we off."</p>

<p>Thus do I briefly make some record of a "trial trip"; and may no
trip that any of us may make, whether involving a trial or not, have
worse results than has this, of which, beginning and finishing happily
and gloriously as it has done&mdash;and such be the <i>Cannie Donia's</i> fate
evermore&mdash;I am privileged to write this slight record, and proud to
account myself henceforth as</p>
